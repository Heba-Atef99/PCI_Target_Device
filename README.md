# PCI_Target_Device
A verilog software project to create a synthesizable PCI Target Device which was able to read or write data from memory according to the given signal from the master. With different scenarios and constraints using test bench that acts as a Master Device to test these scenarios.

## SetUp
For running the different testbenches in the testBenches.v file, you should add the testbench in the Target.v file and simulate the scenario.
